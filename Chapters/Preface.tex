This collection of course notes is dedicated to all the students who have taken ROB 501 Mathematics for Robotics at the University of Michigan. The first class of students in Fall 2014 took on one of two tasks: typesetting in Latex a lecture or creating a numerically oriented HW problem in MATLAB. For their dedication, enthusiasm, and patience with the pilot version of the course, I tip my hat to Pedro Fernando, Jimmy, Vittorio, Kevin, Yuxiao, Katelyn, Omar, Ross, Jakob, Xianan, Mohammad, Jeffrey, Bo, Kurt, Josh, Xiangyu, Sulbin, Connie, Meghan, Su-Yang, Katie, Il Sun, Mia, Yong, Yunxiang, Hiroshi, Yevgeniy, Ming-Yuan, Pengcheng, and Zhiyuan. I have taken your work and expanded it into these notes. Thank you!\\
